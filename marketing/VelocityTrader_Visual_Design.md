# VelocityTrader v7.1 Visual Design Scheme

## 1. Design Philosophy

### Overall Visual Direction

A vision of "Kinetic Precision" - the design emulates the aesthetic of high-tech performance dashboards found in advanced scientific instruments and modern financial terminals. The visual language is built on sharp, clean lines and a structured grid, reflecting the system's algorithmic nature. The core concept is to create an immersive, data-driven environment that feels both powerful and precise, using a dark theme to make critical information glow with clarity.

### Content Density

High Density: The content is extremely technical and data-rich, requiring a layout that can present multiple complex charts, code snippets, and data tables on a single slide. The design prioritizes clarity and efficient information delivery for a technically-minded audience, with a content-to-whitespace ratio of approximately 80/20.

## 2. Color System

**Primary Colors**

- Background color: #1A1D21 (Deep charcoal, creating a professional dark theme)
- Primary color: #00C2FF (Vibrant cyan, representing data and technology)
- Secondary color: #8B5CF6 (Electric violet, adding depth and sophistication)
- Accent color: #F5F5F5 (Clean white, for maximum contrast on key elements)

**Text Colors**

- Dark text (for light backgrounds): #1A1D21
- Light text (for dark backgrounds): #E0E0E0

## 3. Font Design

**Heading Fonts**

- English fonts
  - Chiron Hei HK (A modern geometric sans-serif with sharp lines, creating a strong technological and precise feel - used for main titles and chapter headings)
  - Hedvig Letters Sans (A distinctive font with strong character, ideal for creating a unique brand voice in titles and cover pages)

**Body Fonts**

- English fonts
  - Quattrocento Sans (A classic and highly readable sans-serif, ensuring clarity for dense data and technical explanations - primary body text)
  - Coda (A rounded and friendly sans-serif that can be used for callouts or less formal text - used for annotations and highlights)

## 4. Image Style

Imagery should be abstract and data-centric. Focus on stylized, high-contrast visualizations of financial data, such as glowing line graphs, 3D scatter plots, and architectural diagrams of the algorithm. Use a dark background with cyan and violet data points or lines. Avoid photographic imagery; instead, use clean, minimalist vector graphics and geometric patterns that represent network flows or data structures.
